/// This producer's whole value is that its result is *recorded* — keyed to a
/// sealed commit and reusable as review evidence — and the coordinate it records
/// against is the run's job and logical head. A caller with no run has no such
/// coordinate, and inventing one from the process's working directory is exactly
/// the influence [`crate::execution::checks::manual_check_cache_context`]
/// excludes by construction. So the refusal states the contract rather than the
/// missing field: a shell that should have a run and does not has a plumbing
/// problem worth naming, and a shell that legitimately has none is asking for a
/// capability that does not exist yet.
